/*Engine Specifications*/
/* Description */
  This engine is a 2D multi-purpose tile based game that
  is used for game development. This engine has the
  following features.
  1. Scene Queueing and Manipulation (ie.)
  
    You custom set up different scenes with any amount
   of objects oriented in any fashion. You can set it
   up so it auto queues and changes scenes, depending
   on game state and or conditions.
 * /*2. Custom Input Opportunities (ie.)*/
   Just like in how you can queue scenes, you can
   create various different types of input methods
   that can be triggered and binded from the input
  (class.
 * /*3. Sound (ie.)*/
   It has full sound compatibly and can create
   sound nodes / objects to give surround sound
   and or static sound that follows you.
 * /*4. Collisions (ie.)*/
   In this engine handling collision is simple.
   All you have todo is to make the Scene_Actor
   boolean value for collidable true, and the engine
   will set it in a automatic queue for testing when
   the scene is triggered and playing.
 * /*5. Textures (ie.)*/
   The engine can fully load texture from a selected
   dir. You must specify if there is any sub folders
   that these texture may reside in.
 * /*6. Menus (ie.)*/
   The engine comes with will available menus that
   can be created with a model and handle input
   events specifically, related to what the menu
   type may be.
 * /*7. Events (ie.)*/
   This engine comes with built in event system that
   is closely tied with the input for robust events to
   models, objects and other engine types. The events
   are also tied to the menu greatly.
 * /*8. Models (ie.)*/
   In the engine there is a finite amount of different
   models you can use as this is a 2D tile based engine.
   There are models ranging from squares to triangles
   fully supported with collisions and events.
