*Engine Specifications*

   This engine is a 2D multi-purpose tile based game that
   is used for game development. This engine has the
   following features.
  1. Scene Queueing and Manipulation
  
    You custom set up different scenes with any amount of objects
    oriented in any fashion. You can set it up so it auto queues
    and changes scenes, depending on game state and or conditions.
  2. Custom Input Opportunities
 
    Just like in how you can queue scenes, you can
    create various different types of input methods
    that can be triggered and binded from the input
    class.
  3. Sound
 
    It has full sound compatibly and can create
    sound nodes / objects to give surround sound
    and or static sound that follows you.
  4. Collisions

    In this engine handling collision is simple.
    All you have todo is to make the Scene_Actor
    boolean value for collidable true, and the engine
    will set it in a automatic queue for testing when
    the scene is triggered and playing.
  5. Textures
 
    The engine can fully load texture from a selected
    dir. You must specify if there is any sub folders
    that these texture may reside in.
  6. Menus
 
    The engine comes with will available menus that
    can be created with a model and handle input
    events specifically, related to what the menu
    type may be.
 * /*7. Events (ie.)*/
   This engine comes with built in event system that
   is closely tied with the input for robust events to
   models, objects and other engine types. The events
   are also tied to the menu greatly.
 * /*8. Models (ie.)*/
   In the engine there is a finite amount of different
   models you can use as this is a 2D tile based engine.
   There are models ranging from squares to triangles
   fully supported with collisions and events.
